<p>With the weather in Central Texas, wedding planners will commonly say that you need to love your plan B!&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Chapel enables a picturesque&nbsp;indoor ceremony site protected against the weather by "bringing the outside in" through large windows&nbsp;and lots of natural light, but also allows multi-use of that space when the ceremony is outdoors.&nbsp; The Chapel in essence provides an "insurance policy against the weather" by taking out the stress of what will your ceremony look like if the weather doesn&#39;t cooperate for an outdoor wedding!!</p>
