<p>Canyonwood Ridge strongly encourages its brides to hire a "day-of-coordinator", or have someone who is extremely organized and familiar with weddings to help with logistics on the day of your wedding.&nbsp; There are many small details that get overlooked and it makes the day very hectic trying to resolve issues that a professional can handle. &nbsp;Our staff provides day-of-coordinator services for a fee and they have vast planning experience to address a range of issues, and most importantly,&nbsp;are very familiar with the Venue in order to optimize your set-up and decorating design.</p>
