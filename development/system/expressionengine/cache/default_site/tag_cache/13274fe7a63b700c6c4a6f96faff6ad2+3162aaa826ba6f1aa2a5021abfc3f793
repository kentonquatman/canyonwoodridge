      <p>Canyonwood Ridge is a new Hill Country Wedding and Events Venue in the Austin area,&nbsp;<a href="http://canyonwoodridge.dev/contact">located</a> approximately 20 minutes from downtown Austin and taking reservations for April 1, 2016 and beyond.</p>

<p>The Venue sits on a ridge top wrapped in oak trees with scenic hill country views and was designed specifically for weddings. &nbsp;The outdoor ceremony site, as well as the indoor Chapel, offer planning flexibility and picturesque backdrops.&nbsp; The Chapel enables an indoor ceremony to protect against the unpredictable weather in central Texas, but also allows multi-use of that space, in addition to the large Reception Hall, when the ceremony is outdoors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canyonwood Ridge is unique and romantic with its dramatic views and Hill Country rustic undertones, but maintains a balance of simplicity and flexibility for brides to plan their perfect day.&nbsp; Visit our <a href="http://canyonwoodridge.dev/gallery">Gallery</a> to see several renderings of the Venue, furnishings, and design.</p>
