      <h1>About the Venue</h1>
      <p><em>Canyonwood Ridge</em> is a new "Hill Country Wedding and Events Venue" located 20 minutes from downtown Austin, opening March 2016.</p>
      <p>The Venue sits on a ridge top wrapped in oak trees with scenic views and was designed specifically for weddings. The outdoor ceremony site, as well as the indoor Chapel, offer planning flexibility and picturesque backdrops. The Chapel enables an indoor ceremony to protect against the unpredictable weather in central Texas, but also allows multi-use of that space in addition to the large Reception Hall. Canyonwood Ridge is unique and romantic with its dramatic views and Hill Country rustic undertones, but maintains a balance of simplicity and flexibility for brides to plan their perfect day.</p>
