        <h1>Our Facility</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Canyonwood Ridge was designed specifically for weddings. Our outdoor ceremony site, as well as our indoor Chapel, offer planning flexibility and picturesque backdrops. The Chapel enables an indoor ceremony to protect against the unpredictable weather in central Texas, but also allows multi-use of that space in addition to the large Reception Hall. Canyonwood Ridge is unique and romantic with its dramatic views and Hill Country rustic undertones, but maintains a balance of simplicity and flexibility for brides to plan their perfect day.</p>
